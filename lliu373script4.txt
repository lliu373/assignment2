-- Delete any doctor who got his/her license before Jan 1, 1965:
SELECT * FROM doctor;
SELECT * FROM hospital;
SELECT * FROM docpat;
DELETE FROM doctor WHERE beclis<'1965-01-01';
-- the delete command did not delete the rows because 
-- the foreign key constraint fails in hospital table which 
-- contain the foreign key of licensenumber with doctor table's
-- licensenumberconnect.


-- Create the view:
CREATE VIEW vone AS SELECT patlname, patfname,doclname, hosname FROM doctor,
 patient, hospital, docpat WHERE hospital.hoscode = hospital.hoscode 
and doctor.licensenumber = docpat.licensenumber and patient.ohip = docpat.ohip 
and hospital.licensenumber = doctor.licensenumber and bechead>'1995-12-31';
-- Prove the view works:
SELECT * FROM vone;


-- Delete the doctor with a last name of Clooney:
SELECT * FROM doctor;
SELECT * FROM docpat;
DELETE FROM doctor WHERE doclname = 'Clooney';
-- The delete works because the foreign key include cascade in the treat table(docpat)
-- and the doctor 'Clooney is not head of hospital so it is not 
-- effect to hospital table wich contain foreign key without cascade.
-- Cascade code from treat(docpat) table: CREATE TABLE docpat (licensenumber 
-- CHAR(4) NOT NULL, ohip CHAR(9) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (licensenumber, ohip), 
-- FOREIGN KEY (licensenumber) REFERENCES doctor(licensenumber) 
-- ON DELETE CASCADE,FOREIGN KEY (ohip) REFERENCES patient(ohip) ON DELETE CASCADE);
SELECT * FROM doctor;
SELECT * FROM docpat;


-- Try to delete all the Surgeons:
SELECT * FROM doctor;
SELECT * FROM hospital;
SELECT * FROM docpat;
DELETE FROM doctor WHERE specialty = 'Surgeon'; 
-- the delete command did not delete the rows because
-- the foreign key constraint fails in hospital table which
-- contain the foreign key of licensenumber with doctor table's
-- licensenumberconnect.
SELECT * FROM doctor;
SELECT * FROM hospital;
SELECT * FROM docpat;
